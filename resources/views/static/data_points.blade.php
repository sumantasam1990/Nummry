                        We will show you group comparisons of how much time it took your child to correctly and incorrectly answer the questions .We will have groups of 30 seconds and place every overall category, type of question and individual questions that, for example was answered correctly or incorrectly in 30 seconds versus 2 minutes. This is extremely important because say that your child answer two questions correctly but they answered one in 20 seconds and they answered another one in 2 minutes. Both were answered correctly but maybe your child needs more help coming to the correct answer for the question that was answered in 2 minutes.

This allows you to get a very easy and detailed assessment of which types of questions, specific questions and/or categories your child/students needs to put more work in.

If it was off by 1 number/choice, off by 2-3 numbers/choices or 4 or more numbers/choices. This is vital information because this will allow the teacher to see how much help your child needs in each of the over 250 types of learning exercises.
